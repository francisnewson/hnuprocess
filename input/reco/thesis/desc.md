THESIS MISSION FILES
====================

Yaml files for plots to go in thesis.

beam_corrections.yaml
---------------------
To produce data/mc ratios with or
without beam corrections
Implements roughly the r_K selection.

basic_muon_stats.yaml
---------------------
Basic hit counting etc. to see how MUV works
in MC and data

muon_shapes.yaml
----------------
use a km2 selection with tight mass cut
to study muons with MuonShapes analysis
with/without MC scattering

remove mass cut and lkr veto on km2 selection to 
study pion muon sepration in k2pi 

muv_xy.yaml
-----------
Measure MUV efficiency as a a function of
position at MUV1 and MUV2, with high p muons.

muv_bursts.yaml
---------------
Measure MUV efficiency burst by burst

rk_selection.yaml
-----------------
Reproducing the original rk selection
to check we understand what's going on

extract_k2pi.yaml
-----------------
To be reprocessed with k2pi_reco

halo.yaml
---------
Halo enriched selections to study P5/P6 agreement.
