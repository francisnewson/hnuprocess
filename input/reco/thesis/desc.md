THESIS MISSION FILES
====================

Yaml files for plots to go in thesis.

beam_corrections.yaml
---------------------
To produce data/mc ratios with or without beam corrections
Implements roughly the r_K selection.

basic_muon_stats.yaml
---------------------
basic hit counting etc. to see how MUV works in MC and data

muon_shapes.yaml
----------------

use a km2 selection with tight mass cut
to study muons with MuonShapes analysis
with/without MC scattering

remove mass cut and lkr veto on km2 selection to 
study pion muon sepration in k2pi
